# Pizza Sales Report Project â€“ SQL

## Project Description  
This project showcases the use of SQL to analyze a real-world pizza sales dataset. The objective was to extract key business metrics by writing efficient SQL queries that provide insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends. Through this project, I applied core data analysis skills and translated raw data into meaningful business decisions.
